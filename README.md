# A web interface for MIPS R2000
The aim of this work is to adapt [the console spim simulator](https://sourceforge.net/p/spimsimulator/code/HEAD/tree/spim/) (created by James R. Larus) by compiling it to JavaScript using Emscripten technology, in order to be able to embed the simulator in the web interface.

This project **only shows an approximation of final degree project** (frontend without backend connection), the complete project is stored in a private repository.

Technologies used (only in this approach):
- Emscripten
- ReactJS
- Material UI

IDE: Visual Studio Code
